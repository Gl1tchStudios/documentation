## **Installation Requirements**

### **Dependencies**

* **ox\_lib**: Modern UI framework for menu systems and notifications and more
* **ox\_target**: Standalone "third-eye" targeting resource.
* **ox\_inventory**: Slot-based inventory with metadata.

**Shell Dependencies**

This resource requires interior shell resources to function properly. You must have at least one of the following shell packs installed:

* **lynx\_shells:** A comprehensive collection of pre-built interior shells for various property types
* **K4MB1-StarterShells:** A starter pack of MLO shells providing basic interior environments

**Phone Integration**

This resource is designed to work with **lb-phone** out of the box for job notifications and communication features. However, lb-phone integration is **not strictly required** for the script to function.

The phone-related functions are located in the open source files and can be easily modified to work with your preferred phone resource.

For more help regarding if your phone system works with our script, feel free to open a ticket in our discord.
